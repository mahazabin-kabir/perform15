                    <p>A number of spacecraft are staring directly into the sun. And for good reason.

                                        Space agencies, scientists, and nations want to better understand our stormy sun, a glowing sphere of gas that's capable of energetic explosions from its surface. A common such event is a solar flare, which is an explosion that emits light and energy into space, sometimes towards Earth.</p>
